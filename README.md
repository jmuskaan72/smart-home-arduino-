With the advancement in technology, there has been a shift from Mechanical labour to Technological labour. 
This project involves the generation and working of a Smart Home which consists of some normal appliances that a normal house possesses.
But,
This Smart Home has appliances which perform their 
normal functions in a more efficient and easy way.

##The Smart Home consists of:  

1.Soil-Moisture System:

We used to get worried about our plants because they need water on regular basis and and their condition must be checked from time to time.
  To solve this problem as plants need water according to the moisture level of soil. So I have madeÂ an Automatic Plant Watering System Using Arduino UNO.

2.Automatic  Door-lock system:

This door opens automatically without manual input whenever a person enters or exits the house.
This reduction in manual work makes it a more efficient and easy to use door. 

3.Security System Installed Almirah:

A house also needs a place to secure important belongings.
This smart home has an almirah with door lock to store important items.
The door of the almirah can only be opened by entering a certain set password on the keypad attached with it.

4.Curtain Raiser:

 The curtains will open only when in need that is during the day time to allow the sunlight to enter through the room and will automatically shuts the curtain down during the night time and switch on the
 LED bulb on its own to prevent mechanical work for a person and will also save time.

5.Weather forecast on LCD screen:

Weather is an important factor to determine the location of owning a house.
This Smart home contains an LCD setup which displays us the readings of Temperature and Humidity of the atmosphere.
A DHT11  sensor is used to sense and give the readings of temperature and humidity .
A  (16 x 2) LCD is used as display to show the readings.
